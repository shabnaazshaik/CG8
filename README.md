###Introduction
Breast cancer is a type of Cancer that forms in the cells of the breast. It is the most common cancer among women worldwide, although it can also occur in men, albeit rarely. Breast Cancer can originate from different parts of the breast. Diagnosis of breast cancer involves a combination of imaging tests like mammogram, ultrasound, MRI, and biopsy to examine tissue samples for the presence of cancer cells. About 1 in 40 women die due to this cancer. Early Diagnosis plays a major role here. This research highlights a major in mammographic-based analysis: Resnet-50.In addition to the model, an algorithm is pertained to the model to diagnose the parameters. With this research, we target making progress in early breast cancer detection using Resnet-50.
